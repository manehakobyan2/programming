In our programming class, we focused on understanding the binary 
number system and how to convert numbers between different systems. For example, 
I chose the number 124, which in binary is 1111100, and the number -24, which in binary is 11100100 in two's complement form.
We also explored hexadecimal, decimal, and binary representations, including how to handle large numbers in these systems.
Additionally, we learned about number conversions and how to work with different bases.

During this time, my Ubuntu system unexpectedly stopped working, and I couldnâ€™t pinpoint the cause. 
As a result, I decided to save and share my work on GitHub instead of using Git locally.
