In class, we covered several key topics. We learned about data representation,
focusing on ontologies and how they structure information. We also explored
different types of algorithms, understanding their various uses and functions.
Additionally, we started writing code and implemented an algorithm to reverse anumber, practicing how to translate logic into code.
