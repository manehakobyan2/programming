In our class on March 4, we re-learned how to work with files in C. We practiced opening, reading from, and writing to files using functions like fopen, fclose, and others. The task involved reading data from a file (data.txt), processing it, and writing the results to another file (result.txt). We also revisited error handling in file operations to ensure that files open successfully before performing any actions on them.
