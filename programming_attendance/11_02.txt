On February 11, we introduced problem-solving in computer science, focusing on 
the definition and key properties of algorithms, such as being well-ordered and unambiguous. We explored why studying algorithms is important and compared 
different approaches through examples. Additionally, we discussed algorithm design principles, including inputs, outputs, conditions, and termination 
considerations.
