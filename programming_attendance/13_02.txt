On February 13, we moved on to pointers and arrays, discussing how they work in memory and their role in efficient data management. We covered pointer 
arithmetic, array indexing, and how pointers can be used to manipulate arrays. 
Additionally, we had a quiz to assess our understanding of the topics covered in previous classes.
