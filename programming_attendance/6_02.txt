During the class, we learned about data representation and how different types
 of data are stored and processed in computers. We covered the concepts of
 signed and unsigned numbers, understanding how they are represented in binary
 format. The class also introduced binary arithmetic, including addition,
 subtraction, and multiplication, which are essential for performing operations on binary numbers.
 We explored how signed numbers can represent both positive and negative values using techniques like two's complement. Overall, the session provided a solid
 foundation in how computers manipulate data at the binary level.
